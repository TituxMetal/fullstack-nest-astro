# Progress

## What Works

- Backend and frontend apps are functional as separate entities in the monorepo.
- Turborepo orchestrates builds, tests, and other tasks efficiently.
- Docker builds are managed through workspace scripts and working correctly.
- Documentation follows a DRY, developer-friendly structure.
- Environment configuration follows security best practices.
- Prisma migrations and database setup are properly documented.
- Authentication system with JWT cookies is implemented and working reliably.
- User profile page with view and edit capabilities is fully implemented and tested.
- Form validation with Zod schemas is functioning correctly with proper edge case handling.
- Unit tests for React components follow the AAA pattern and provide comprehensive coverage.
- API services for user data are integrated, working, and thoroughly tested.
- Environment variable handling is properly implemented for both server and client components.
- Docker and Docker Compose configurations are working correctly.
- Commit message formatting follows conventional commit standards.
- All core authentication and user management features are complete and functional.

## What's Left to Build

- User avatar upload functionality.
- Password change functionality in a dedicated flow.
- Additional user dashboard features and data visualization.
- Enhanced form error messaging and UX improvements.
- More comprehensive test coverage for edge cases and error scenarios.
- User preferences or settings management.
- Real-time features or notifications.
- Development troubleshooting guides.
- Enhanced Docker Compose configuration for development workflows.

## Current Status

- Core functionality is complete and working: authentication, user registration, profile management.
- Documentation is comprehensive, DRY, and developer-friendly.
- Docker builds and deployment workflows are established and working.
- Environment configuration is properly secured and documented.
- Project structure and workflows are clearly documented.
- User profile management is fully implemented with comprehensive testing.
- Backend-frontend API integration is robust and reliable.
- Environment variable handling correctly implements different patterns for server and client
  contexts.
- Commit message conventions are established and followed.
- All implemented features have proper test coverage following AAA pattern.
- The application is ready for production deployment with current feature set.

## Known Issues

- Empty strings in form fields need careful handling due to validation constraints (resolved through
  proper schema design).
- API service mocking in tests requires specific order of imports (documented pattern).
- Docker Compose configuration could be enhanced for development workflows.
- Some documentation sections could benefit from more detailed troubleshooting guides.
- .env.example files may not be visible in the repository for security reasons.

## Evolution of Project Decisions

- Moved from direct Docker commands to workspace scripts for better maintainability.
- Adopted a DRY approach to documentation reducing redundancy.
- Centralized common information in root README while maintaining app-specific details.
- Focused app-specific READMEs on unique aspects and implementation details.
- Maintained clear separation between backend and frontend codebases.
- Followed secure practices for environment configuration with proper server/client distinction.
- Implemented cookie-based JWT authentication for enhanced security.
- Used React Hook Form with Zod for reliable and user-friendly form handling.
- Adopted local state management for optimistic UI updates and better UX.
- Used semantic HTML structure for accessibility and maintainability.
- Established consistent testing patterns using AAA format across all components.
- Implemented conventional commit standards for better version control and project tracking.
- Created separate environment variable patterns for server-side and client-side code.
- Properly managed cookie-based authentication across both frontend and backend.
- Achieved comprehensive test coverage for all implemented features.
- Established patterns for type-safe API communication and error handling.
