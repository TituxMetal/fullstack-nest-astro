# Product Context

## Why This Project Exists

This project aims to provide a robust, scalable, and maintainable fullstack web application template
for rapid development. It addresses the common pain points of inconsistent tooling, complex
deployment, and setup challenges in modern web development.

## Problems Solved

- Provides a structured monorepo setup that maintains clean separation of concerns.
- Simplifies development and deployment with a unified monorepo and Turborepo orchestration.
- Ensures consistent tooling and patterns across the codebase.
- Implements secure, cookie-based authentication with clear frontend-backend boundaries.
- Provides standardized environment variable handling for different contexts (server/client).

## How It Should Work

- Developers work within a single repository for all apps.
- Each application (backend, frontend) maintains its own types and validation logic.
- Builds, tests, and deployments are orchestrated from the root using Turborepo.
- Each stack (backend, frontend) can be developed, tested, and deployed independently or together.
- Authentication is handled through secure JWT cookies.
- Environment variables follow clear patterns: server-only vs. client-accessible.

## User Experience Goals

- Fast, responsive, and reliable web application for end users.
- Consistent and intuitive developer experience for contributors.
- Easy onboarding for new developers through clear documentation and structure.
- Type-safe development experience within each application.
- Clear patterns for authentication and data validation.
