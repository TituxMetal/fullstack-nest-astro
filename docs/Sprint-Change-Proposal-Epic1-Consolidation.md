# Sprint Change Proposal: Epic 1 Story Consolidation

**Date:** 2025-07-31  
**Author:** Scrum Master (SM Agent)  
**Change Type:** Story Structure Consolidation  
**Affected Epic:** Epic 1 - Monorepo Restructuring

## Analysis Summary

### Original Issue

The original Epic 1 design contained **4 separate stories (1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4)** that created an
**uncommittable and untestable workflow**:

- **Story 1.1**: Create empty `apps/` and `packages/` directories → **NOT COMMITABLE** (incomplete
  work)
- **Story 1.2**: Move `backend/` and `web/` to `apps/` → **NOT COMMITABLE** (broken state until
  configs updated)
- **Story 1.3**: Update root configuration files → **NOT COMMITABLE** (Docker still broken)
- **Story 1.4**: Update Docker configurations → **FINALLY COMMITABLE** (complete, working state)

### Impact Analysis

Each individual story left the system in a **non-functional state**, violating BMAD principles:

- Developers could not commit work after Stories 1.1-1.3
- Testing was impossible until all 4 stories were complete
- No incremental value delivery
- High risk of integration issues

### Rationale for Consolidation

Epic 1 represents a **single, atomic refactoring operation** that must be completed as one unit to
maintain system functionality. The four "stories" were actually **implementation phases** of one
comprehensive change.

## Epic Impact Summary

### Before Consolidation

- **4 separate stories** with complex dependencies
- **3 non-commitable intermediate states**
- **Impossible to test incrementally**
- **High integration risk**

### After Consolidation

- **1 comprehensive story** (Story 1.1: Complete Monorepo Restructuring)
- **Single commitable, testable unit**
- **Clear acceptance criteria covering all aspects**
- **Atomic delivery of value**

## Specific Proposed Edits

### 1. Updated Epic 1 Document (`docs/prd/epic-1-monorepo-restructuring.md`)

**COMPLETED** - Consolidated all 4 stories into:

- **Story 1.1: Complete Monorepo Restructuring**
- **16 Acceptance Criteria** covering directory structure, configuration updates, and system
  functionality
- **10 Integration Verification points** ensuring complete system validation

### 2. Updated Story File (`docs/stories/1.1.story.md`)

**COMPLETED** - Transformed into comprehensive implementation guide:

- **16-step task breakdown** organized in logical phases
- **Complete acceptance criteria** from all original stories
- **Comprehensive testing requirements**

### 3. Updated Main PRD (`docs/prd.md`)

**COMPLETED** - Replaced Epic 1 section with consolidated story structure

### 4. Verification of Other Documents

**COMPLETED** - Confirmed no other documents require updates

## Recommended Path Forward

### Implementation Approach

The consolidated **Story 1.1** follows a **5-phase implementation**:

1. **Phase 1**: Directory Structure Setup
2. **Phase 2**: Move Applications (with git history preservation)
3. **Phase 3**: Update Root Configuration
4. **Phase 4**: Update Docker Configuration
5. **Phase 5**: Comprehensive Testing

### Benefits of Consolidation

- ✅ **Commitable Work**: Each commit represents functional state
- ✅ **Testable Units**: Complete system can be tested after implementation
- ✅ **Atomic Delivery**: Single story delivers complete value
- ✅ **Reduced Risk**: No intermediate broken states
- ✅ **Clear Handoff**: Complete specification for implementation

### Development Workflow

1. **Developer implements all phases** as described in Story 1.1
2. **All 16 acceptance criteria** must be met before commit
3. **All 10 integration verification points** must pass
4. **Single pull request** contains complete restructuring
5. **Story marked complete** only when system is fully functional

## Artifact Adjustment Needs

All necessary documentation updates have been completed:

- ✅ `docs/prd/epic-1-monorepo-restructuring.md` - Consolidated story structure
- ✅ `docs/stories/1.1.story.md` - Comprehensive implementation guide
- ✅ `docs/prd.md` - Updated Epic 1 section
- ✅ All cross-references verified and updated

## PRD MVP Impact

**NO IMPACT** - This change improves delivery methodology without affecting MVP scope or goals. The
monorepo restructuring functionality remains identical; only the delivery approach has been
optimized.

## High-Level Action Plan

### Immediate Next Steps

1. **Development Team**: Implement Story 1.1 using 5-phase approach
2. **Quality Assurance**: Validate all 16 acceptance criteria
3. **Integration Testing**: Verify all 10 integration points
4. **Deployment**: Confirm Docker and production readiness

### Success Criteria

- ✅ All Epic 1 documentation updated and consistent
- ✅ Single story provides complete implementation guidance
- ✅ Development workflow supports atomic commits
- ✅ System remains functional throughout implementation

## Agent Handoff Plan

**No additional agent handoff required** - This consolidation completes the course correction. The
development team can proceed with implementing the consolidated Story 1.1 using standard BMAD
methodology.

## Final Assessment

**CHANGE SUCCESSFULLY IMPLEMENTED** - Epic 1 has been consolidated from 4 uncommittable stories into
1 comprehensive, atomic story that can be implemented, committed, and tested as a complete unit.
This change eliminates broken intermediate states and ensures deliverable value aligned with BMAD
principles.

**Document Status:** Complete  
**Approval Required:** User approval of consolidation approach  
**Next Action:** Development team implementation of consolidated Story 1.1
