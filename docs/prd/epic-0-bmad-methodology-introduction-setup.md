## Story 0.4: Finalize Project Cleanup and Documentation

- **Status**: **To Do**
- **User Story**: As a developer joining the project, I need the legacy `memory-bank` documentation
  removed and the `README.md` files updated so that I can quickly understand the current project
  structure and methodology.
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  1. The `memory-bank/` directory at the project root MUST be deleted.
  2. The main `README.md` at the project root MUST be updated to accurately reflect the new project
     structure and development methodology.
  3. All other `README.md` files (e.g., in `backend/`, `frontend/`) MUST be reviewed and updated to
     be consistent with the new project standards.

- **Integration Verification**: BMAD documentation structure is in place, memory bank files removed,
  and the team can follow a clear, documented workflow for story validation.
