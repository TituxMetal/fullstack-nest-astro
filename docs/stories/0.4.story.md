as_a: 'developer joining the project'
i_want: 'the legacy `memory-bank` documentation removed and the `README.md` files updated'
so_that: 'I can quickly understand the current project structure and methodology'
acceptance_criteria:
  - 'AC0.4.1: The `memory-bank/` directory at the project root MUST be deleted.'
  - 'AC0.4.2: The main `README.md` at the project root MUST be updated to accurately reflect the new
    project structure and development methodology.'
  - 'AC0.4.3: All other `README.md` files (e.g., in `backend/`, `frontend/`) MUST be reviewed and
    updated to be consistent with the new project standards.'
dev_notes:
  - '**Project Structure**: This story involves file deletion and updates to documentation. All
    changes must align with the `docs/architecture/source-tree.md` document. [Source:
    docs/architecture/source-tree.md]'
  - '**Coding Standards**: While no code is being written, the updated `README.md` files should
    follow the general documentation standards. [Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md]'
  - '**Tech Stack**: The root `README.md` should mention the key technologies outlined in
    `docs/architecture/tech-stack.md`. [Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack.md]'
  - '**Testing**: No new tests are required. The developer should ensure that no repository commands
    are broken after the changes. Manual verification is sufficient. [Source:
    docs/architecture/test-strategy-and-standards.md]'
tasks:
  - '1. Delete the `memory-bank/` directory from the project root. (AC: 0.4.1)'
  - '2. Read the `docs/architecture/source-tree.md` and `docs/architecture/tech-stack.md` documents.'
  - '3. Update the root `README.md` to reflect the project structure and technology stack. (AC:
    0.4.2)'
  - '4. Review and update `backend/README.md` to be consistent with the project standards. (AC:
    0.4.3)'
  - '5. Review and update `frontend/README.md` to be consistent with the project standards. (AC:
