epic: '1'
story_id: '1.1'
title: 'Create Apps and Packages Directory Structure'
status: 'Approved'
as_a: 'developer working in the monorepo'
i_want: 'the root directory to have dedicated `apps` and `packages` folders'
so_that: 'I can clearly distinguish between deployable applications and reusable packages'
acceptance_criteria:
  - 'AC1.1.1: Root directory contains new empty `apps/` directory'
  - 'AC1.1.2: Root directory contains new empty `packages/` directory'
  - 'AC1.1.3: Existing `backend/` and `frontend/` directories remain untouched during this story'
  - 'AC1.1.4: All existing Turborepo commands (`yarn build`, `yarn test`, `yarn lint`) continue to
    work without changes'
dev_notes:
  - 'This story is foundational and should not alter any existing code.'
  - 'The new directories `apps/` and `packages/` should be created at the root of the monorepo.'
  - 'No changes to `turbo.json`, `package.json`, or any other configuration files are expected in
    this story.'
  - '**Source Tree Reference**: The target structure is defined in
    `docs/architecture/source-tree.md`. This story creates the top-level `apps/` and `packages/`
    directories.'
  - '**Testing**: No new tests are required for this story, but existing tests must continue to
    pass. The CI pipeline should run successfully.'
tasks:
  - '1. Create an empty `apps` directory in the project root. (AC: 1.1.1)'
  - '2. Create an empty `packages` directory in the project root. (AC: 1.1.2)'
  - '3. Run `yarn test` to ensure no existing tests are broken. (AC: 1.1.4)'
  - '4. Run `yarn build` to ensure the build process is unaffected. (AC: 1.1.4)'
  - '5. Run `yarn lint` to ensure linting is unaffected. (AC: 1.1.4)'
