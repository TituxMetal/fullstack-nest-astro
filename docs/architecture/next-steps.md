# Next Steps

After completing this architecture document:

## For Epic 0 (BMAD Setup)

- Use this document as the architectural foundation for Epic 0-4 implementation
- Reference architectural patterns when creating BMAD story breakdowns
- Ensure Epic stories align with the architectural decisions documented here

## For Epic 1-4 Implementation

- **Epic 1**: Use Source Tree section as guide for monorepo restructuring
- **Epic 2**: Follow Clean Architecture + DDD patterns defined in Components and Coding Standards
  sections
- **Epic 3**: Use component-type organization patterns from Source Tree and Components sections
- **Epic 4**: Implement shared configuration packages as defined in Tech Stack section

## For Development Teams

- Reference this document for all architectural decisions during Epic implementation
- Use TDD approach defined in Test Strategy for Clean Architecture learning
- Follow security requirements for all AI and human development
- Maintain API contracts defined in REST API Spec section

## Architecture Evolution

- Update this document when architectural patterns evolve
- Review and validate architectural decisions at Epic completion milestones
- Use this blueprint for future feature development after Epic 0-4 completion

**This architecture document serves as the definitive blueprint for BMAD methodology transformation
while preserving excellent existing patterns and optimizing for Clean Architecture + DDD learning.**
